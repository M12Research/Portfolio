                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p>If only I knew how much was wrong with this little machine... </p>
                <p>This 2005 Tomos A35 was trying to become one with nature again, intil I came along. If you know anything about wrenching, you know that sitting stationary, exposed to the elements is about the worst situation a vehicle can be in. This moped spend 5 years doing just that. The engine was seized, brakes froze up, rust everywhere. It needed a lot of love to be able to work again.</p>

                <h3>First Drive!</h3>
                <p>After a lot of tinkering with my brother, we got this thing running again. It needed a full rebuild and the wheels needed a crowbar to be even able to roll. A lot of blood sweat and tears went into even getting it moving and stopping by itself, and I learned a lot doing it. Driving it for the first time is something truly magical (as you can tell from my big smile)</p>

                <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
                <p>After driving it all the way back to Eindhoven from Nijmegen, barely making it. It was time to customize the moped a bit. I always liked an old cafe racer/scrambler look on motorcycles, so I tried to find some used parts that would fit this project. I always like to scavenge second hand stores and online marketplaces for parts. I like how it creates creative challenges to make all the pieces fit together. I popped on a big old motorcycle headlight, a custom made taillight embedded in the luggage rack, low handlebars and a Kreidler dirt bike saddle.</p>

                <h3>Fresh paint</h3>
                <p>There were some unadressed rust spots on the frame that stood out like a sore thumb. The frame was aesthetically becoming the weakest link of the build, so I decided to respray it. If there is anything I have learned from building guitars and refinishing objects, it is that 90% of a good finish is a preparations. So I sanded the whole frame down and sanded the rusty spots to bare metal. I then did several layers of primer, a few coats of light blue 2K laquer, inspired by the Gulf livery of classic racecars like the Ford GT40. I love the contrast between such an awefully slow vehicle and a quick appearance.</p>

                <h3>More Engine work</h3>
                <p>By this time I think I already redid the engine 3 times. After trying and failing many times, this time I wanted to properly build it. Renew all the neccessary items, new piston, new cylinder, clutch etc. It turns out that these engines encounter quite a lot of abuse, 2-stroke, and either accellerating or on their maximum revs. After talking to some other Tomos-owners, I found that each Tomos has its own little issues and percussive sounds, "you just have to learn live with it"</p>

                <h3>Complete?</h3>
                <p>Every time I fix the next weakest link, I feel like I have finished this bike. By this time that would probably be the 20th time. As it turns out, if you like tinkering more than riding, you will never finish. But I am very proud to drive on this machine, knowing how much effort went into it. When driving it around in the city, I get a lot of positives responses. Mostly from people who use to own a moped like this back in the day, or people wondering what kind of Frankenstein I made and looking at the Tomos logo like: there is no way this is a Tomos.</p>

                <h3>Complete (For now)</h3>
                <p>Another big change in the design of the moped. I changed the wheels, tires, front fork, swing arm and upgraded to hydraulic brakes in the front. These upgrades made the ride way more stable and safe, but also I feel like the proportions are better this way. It now is the scaled down low power 'motorcycle' I always wanted to have. For now I consider it finished, but there is more on the agenda of this motorcycle. This project has taught me so much. Things can be so perfect in their imperfections...</p>
