                <h4>P1</h4>
                <p>I am a designer committed to creating meaningful
and enduring interactions. My work centers on
designing experiences and products that foster deep
connections between users and the technologies they
engage with, especially as we navigate the transformative
potential of AI and emerging technologies.</p>

                <h4>P2</h4>
                <p>In an era dominated by the pursuit of efficiency, I prioritize
the richness of interaction over convenience. Meaningful
interactions are often found in practices that require
intention and engagement—actions that invite users to slow
down, connect deeply, and appreciate the process. I strive to
explore and reimagine these interactions, integrating their value
into modern technology to create products that are not only
functional but also resonate on a human level.</p>

                <p>Aesthetics play a vital role in my design philosophy. I aim to evoke
positive emotions through my designs, whether by using uplifting
colors, harmonious forms, or embedding joy and optimism in the
experience itself. I believe aesthetics have the power to transform a
product into something that inspires, uplifts, and fosters connection.
I design with sleek yet bold forms, emphasizing thoughtfulness and
storytelling, ensuring each product tells a unique story that users can
connect with on an emotional level.</p>

                <p>Durability is another cornerstone of my philosophy—not just in physical
longevity but in the ability of products to form lasting relationships with
their users. By designing for repairability and reusability, I aim to empower
users to maintain and adapt their tools, contributing to a more sustainable and
circular economy. This approach ensures that the products I design remain
valuable over time, encouraging users to cherish them rather than replace
them.</p>

                <p>As we enter a future shaped by rapid technological advancements, my mission as a designer is clear: to integrate
emerging technologies into practices that amplify meaningful human experiences. By blending the richness
of intentional interaction, the optimism of thoughtful aesthetics, and the possibilities of modern technology, I
aim to design products that feel enriching, personal, and relevant in today’s world.</p>

            <h3>Professional Identity</h3>
            <p>
I am a designer who challenges assumptions by making alternative possibilities tangible. I identify assumptions embedded in how we design and what we design: inherited conventions that persist not because they're optimal, but because they're familiar. My work questions these defaults and builds evidence that different approaches are viable.
My strength lies in translating theoretical possibilities into experienceable reality. I bridge academic rigor with hands-on realization, taking concepts that exist only in research or speculation and manifesting them as working prototypes. For example, while theoretical work explored maximizing AI uncertainty in design processes, I built systems that actually do it, creating valuable artifacts that demonstrate how uncertainty can be productive rather than problematic. This ability to understand complex concepts and then make them real is where I thrive.
I use high-fidelity prototyping as proof of concept. When I challenge a design assumption, I don't just argue for alternatives. I build them. By creating prototypes that approach production quality, I make new possibilities undeniable. People can touch, interact with, and experience designs that break from convention, forcing a reckoning with whether existing archetypes still make sense. These prototypes become arguments: this could work, this does work.
Constraint-breaking is central to my methodology. I deliberately use tools outside their intended context, designing in unexpected software and combining incompatible techniques, because working against habitual patterns surfaces possibilities that conventional approaches miss. When everyone uses the same tools in the same ways, outputs converge toward sameness. By breaking these mental constraints, I access different primitives and operations that lead to genuinely novel results.
Form becomes a tool for making challenges visible. Bold, unconventional aesthetics signal that different possibilities exist and invite reconsideration of how products should look, feel, and function. I combine design with electronics, mechanics, graphics, and sound to realize complete prototypes that tell their full story through direct experience.
My process is experimental by necessity. When challenging established patterns, there's no blueprint to follow. I work iteratively and hands-on, building and testing to discover what emerges when familiar constraints are removed. This approach grounds me in reality while exploring what's possible beyond convention.
